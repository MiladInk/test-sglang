      "Prompt: The future of AI is\n",
      "Generated text:  a hot topic in the machine learning community. Let's explore this idea further by examining some historical events and their impact on AI. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. In 1987, the US government decided to build the Perseus supercomputer, which was the first True Massively Multif-speed Computer (MIMD) to be mass produced. This event marked a significant step forward in the development of AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In 1990, the AI community was surveyed, and it was found that 60% of the respondents had a graduate degree in AI, while 30% had a doctorate. This survey indicated the growing importance of advanced AI techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In 1996, the AI community was surveyed again, and it was found that 85% of the respondents had a graduate degree in AI, while only 10% had a doctorate. This survey indicated the increasing role of machine learning in AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. In 2008, the AI community was surveyed again, and it was found that 90% of the respondents had a graduate degree in AI, while only 5% had a doctorate. This survey indicated the challenging role of AI in areas like image recognition and natural language processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's apply some statistical analysis to these events. Suppose we have a sample of 1000 respondents for each survey. Calculate the number of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI for each survey.\n",
      "To determine the number of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI for each survey, we need to calculate 1000 times the percentage of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI for each survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For the 1987 survey:\n",
      "   - The percentage of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI is 60%.\n",
      "   - The number of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI is \\(60\\% \\times 1000 = 0.60 \\times 1000 = 600\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For the 1990 survey:\n",
      "   - The percentage of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI is 30%.\n",
      "   - The number of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI is \\(30\\% \\times 1000 = 0.30 \\times 1000 = 300\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. For the 1996 survey:\n",
      "   - The percentage of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI is 85%.\n",
      "   - The number of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI is \\(85\\% \\times 1000 = 0.85 \\times 1000 = 850\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. For the 2008 survey:\n",
      "   - The percentage of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI is 90%.\n",
      "   - The number of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI is \\(90\\% \\times 1000 = 0.90 \\times 1000 = 900\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the number of respondents who had a graduate degree in AI for each survey is:\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\boxed{600, 300, 850, 900}\n",
      "\\] respectively for the 1987, 1990, 1996, and 2008 surveys. These numbers reflect the increasing importance of graduate degrees in AI over the years. \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n"

The nth term of a geometric series \\\\(a + ar + ar^2 + \\\\ldots\\\\) is given by \\\\(a + ar + ar^2 + \\\\ldots = a\\\\left(\\\\frac{r}{1-r}\\\\right)\\\\). Therefore, the nth term is \\\\(\\\\frac{3}{206}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{103}\\\\right)^{n-1}\\\\). The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by \\\\(\\\\frac{a}{1-r}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is the first term and \\\\(r\\\\) is the common ratio. \\n\\nThus, the sum of the series is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{3}{206}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{103}\\\\right)^{n-1}\\n$$\\n\\nThis infinite series can be re-written as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{3}{206} \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{103}\\\\right)^{n-1}\\n$$\\n\\nTo solve this, we can use the formula for a geometric series sum:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{a}{1-r} = \\\\frac{3}{206} \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{103}\\\\right)^{n-1}\\n$$\\n\\nWe can simplify the right side of the equation:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{3}{206} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\frac{1}{103}}\\n$$\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{3}{206} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{103}{102}\\n$$\\n\\nSo, we have:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{3}{206} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{103}{102} = \\\\frac{3}{206 \\\\cdot 102} = \\\\frac{3}{21242}\\n$$\\n\\nTherefore, the sum of the series is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{3}{21242}\\n$$\\n\\nAnd converting it to a decimal gives us:\\n\\n$$\\n0.001440026664\\n$$',\n",
